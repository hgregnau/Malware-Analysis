**Malware Analysis Report**

## Primary Objective
The primary objective of this assignment is to isolate and inspect malware using advanced malware analysis tools.

## Results
To complete this analysis, we began by setting up a sandbox environment to facilitate communication with the REMnux analysis machine. This required modifying the network settings to route all network traffic through the REMnux machine by configuring it as the default gateway.

Next, we analyzed the malware file using PEStudio. This initial examination provided us with hash values and various other indicators. Notably, PEStudio flagged the file as potential ransomware.

Following this, we transferred the malware file to the REMnux machine using WinSCP for further analysis. On the REMnux machine, we utilized the `olevba.py` Python script to scan the file. The scan revealed several suspicious elements, including the capability to create certain files or processes upon execution.

Subsequently, we employed FakeDNS and INetSim to simulate internet traffic. We then executed the malware file on the vulnerable machine. Despite being a .doc file, it contained embedded code designed to make HTTP requests to domains such as `911concept.com` and `firelabo.com`.

The INetSim report further indicated the malware's attempts to retrieve images and other files from the internet. In the process tree, we identified `winprivesc.exe`, which appeared to be a privilege escalation tool. Process Monitor logs confirmed that the malware had modified registry entries on the operating system.

## Conclusion
The analysis provided valuable insights into the malware's behavior, indicating its potential to perform malicious activities such as ransomware attacks and privilege escalation.
